## Are you ready to evade the ever-looming censorship? 
### Experience [Here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/update-for-game)

Escape From Censorship' is the first game I've crafted. In this 2D casual game, you play as Eth, making your escape from censorship against a backdrop of a dark forest. Heal yourself with green pills along the way.

Censorship is an increasingly inescapable topic in our times, from the CZ and Binance incidents to Tornado Cash sanctions by the US government, and the recent arrest of privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet samourai's developers. Perhaps we are all destined to become like the 'cypherpunks' of lore: rats in the opera house, existing in the shadows, constantly wary of pervasive surveillance.

'Escape From Censorship' is born from such a narrative. As its creator, I hope to continue our cherished traditions of privacy, openness, and respect for open-source values; and I wish for us to have more freedom to run in the crypto dark forest.
